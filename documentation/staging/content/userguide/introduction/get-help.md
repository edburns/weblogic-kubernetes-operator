### Oracle Slack

We have a closely monitored public Slack channel where you can get in touch with us to ask questions about using the operator or give us feedback
or suggestions about what features and improvements you would like to see.
We can also create dedicated private channels upon request.
We would love to hear from you.

To join our public channel,
please [visit this site to get an invitation](https://weblogic-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com/).  The invitation email will include
details of how to access our Slack workspace.  After you are logged in, please come to `#operator` and say, "hello!"

### Oracle support

We strongly recommend leveraging [Oracle slack](#Oracle slack) in order to quickly get help
from dedicated operator experts for most issues. If this is insufficient, then feel free
to access Oracle support for help running WebLogic Server domains on Kubernetes platforms.

To access Oracle support,
see [WebLogic Server Certifications on Kubernetes in My Oracle Support Doc ID 2349228.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=208317433106215&id=2349228.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=c2nhai8p3_4).

Alternatively, consider submitting a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/issues) on the
WebLogic Kubernetes Operator project.
